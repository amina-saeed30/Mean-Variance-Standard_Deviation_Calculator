Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
The Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator is a simple Python project that allows users to compute key statistical measures: mean, variance, and standard deviation. It uses the NumPy library for efficient numerical calculations.

How It Works:
User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter numbers separated by spaces.
These numbers are converted into a list of floating-point values.
Error Handling:

If no numbers are entered, the program notifies the user and exits.
Calculating Statistical Measures:

Mean: The average value of the numbers.
Variance: The measure of how much the numbers deviate from the mean.
Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, showing how spread out the values are.
Displaying Results:

The computed mean, variance, and standard deviation are displayed to the user.
Purpose of the Project:
Helps in basic statistical analysis of a dataset.
Useful for students, data analysts, and researchers needing quick calculations.
Provides a foundation for more advanced data science and machine learning applications.
